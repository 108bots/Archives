NETWORK TOPOLOGY DESIGNER
=========================

This software provides the following options:

1) The first option "Random Example" generates a graph of random
   number of nodes (less than 100). It uses a default degree
   constraint of 2 and diameter constraint of 4.

2) The second option takes the number of nodes and the constraints
   as a user input, but uses a random number of nodes to generate
   the topology.

3) The third option takes all values, nodes, constraints and node
   co-ordinates as user input.

4) The "Reset" Option clears the canvas and is ready for the next run.

5) The statistics options shows some of the statistics such as, the 
   topology cost, the execution time etc. for that run.

6) Help prints this information.

7) About displays about the creator of this software.
