Making the jar files for SSTF (Steps)
=============================

NOTE:  1) For Successful Running of SSTF, the current Directory structure should be maintained.
====      SSTF project was developed using Eclipse IDE. Hence this directory can be easily imported into
          Eclipse workspace.

       2) The SSTF jar executable must be found under the working/SIPStrezz/ directory.
       
Step 1:   To Create jar executable
----------------------------------

a) go to working/SIPStrezz/bin/ directory

b) Execute command:          jar cfm sstf-01.jar Manifest.txt strezzer/*.class

c) Move the jar file to working/SIPStrezz/bin/ :     mv sstf-01.jar ../

NOTE: Alternatively, if you are running on Linux, you simply run the script working/SIPStrezz/BuildSSTF.sh 
====

Step 2:  To Create jar archive of the entire working directory
------------------------------------------------------------

a) Go to the direcotry containing the SSTF working directory ( say sstf-setup/)

b) Execute command:         jar -cf sstf-setup.jar sstf-setup/


Extracting the setup jar file
==============================
Go to the directory containing the sstf-setup.jar and execute the command: 

 jar -xvf sstf-setup.jar


Executing the SSTF application
===============================
 
Go to working/SIPStrezz/ directory and execute command:    java -jar sstf-01.jar
